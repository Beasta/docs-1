# Installation

This guide is broken into five parts:

+ [Acquiring an Urbit Identity](#acquire)
+ [Using Bridge](#bridge)
+ [Installing Arvo](#arvo)
+ [Booting Your Ship](#boot)
+ [Basic Operations](#operation)

_If you just want to install the Urbit OS, Arvo, and don't need to be on the
Urbit network, you can skip to [Installing Arvo](#arvo)._

;=
  ;h2
    ;div(id "acquire"): Acquiring an Urbit Identity
  ==
==

Urbit's identity layer, called Azimuth, is a suite of contracts on the Ethereum
blockchain. An Azimuth address, called a *point*, functions as an identity and
a network address for Arvo, the Urbit OS. An instance of Arvo is called a
*ship*. A ship can't use the Arvo network until it's combined with a point.

Throughout this guide, we'll refer to \"Urbit identities\" and \"points\"
interchangeably.

Points are generally not freely available, so you will need to either
purchase one or get one from a friend. This guide assumes you have found a way
to acquire a point.

If you went through the address registration process and used [Wallet Generator](https://github.com/urbit/urbit-wallet-generator),
then you should have have received a .zip file that contains an Ethereum address
and cryptographic secrets in the form of a PDF.

Your ownership PDF contains two secrets that must be kept safe.

- *Master Ticket*: This is a master key that allows you to manage every aspect of
  your address.

- *Ownership Seed BIP39 Mnemonic*: The master ticket encoded as a BIP39 mnemonic
  for compatibility with most Ethereum wallet software, including our own *Bridge*
  client.

;=
  ;h2
    ;div(id "bridge"): Using Bridge
  ==
==

Bridge is client that we built for accessing and managing your Urbit identities.
Like Wallet Generator, Bridge is a web application that can also be run in offline mode.
It can be run in Firefox on all platforms, and also in Chrome if you're using
a Mac.

Importantly, Bridge also allows you to generate a keyfile that
you will need to boot your ship on the Arvo network for the first time. Once a ship
with a keyfile, you can restart it later without the keyfile.

*Note* Bridge allows you to make _writes_ to the blockchain, but we ask you to confirm
anything that will incur a transaction cost. If you plan to do anything heavy-duty, make
sure your Ethereum address has some pocket ETH.

Download bridge [here](https://github.com/urbit/bridge/releases) and follow
the instructions below.

#### Step 1: Welcome

Click `Open a Wallet`.

#### Step 2: Select a Network

On the dropdown menu, make sure that `Main Network` is selected. Then click
`Continue ->`.

#### Step 3: Open a Wallet

On this dropdown menu, choose how you'd like to access your Ethereum wallet.
If you aren't using a hardware wallet (we support Ledger and Trezor), you'll
want to use your Ethereum wallet's BIP39 Mnemonic.

If you used Wallet Generator to generate an HD wallet, you have a few choices:
you can choose `Urbit Master Ticket,` which is high-value, but allows you unfettered
permissions to update your point. The mnemonic associated with your management
seed is also useful to perform everyday operations (such as boot your ship!).

Select the appropriate option and click `Continue ->`.

#### Step 4: (optional) Accept Your Transfer

If you were sent a point by a friend, then you should see a graphic under
`Incoming Transfers`. Click the `Details ->` link under that graphic.

Now you'll be on the management page of your point. The transfer isn't completed
yet, so click `Accept incoming transfer`. Then check both boxes and and click
their associated `Sign Transaction` and `Send Transaction` buttons.

If you already own a point, then click on the `Details ->` under your sigil in the
`Your Points` section.

#### Step 5: (optional) Set Your Networking Keys

If you just accepted a point, you'll be returned to your point screen. Notice that
that links and buttons are now clickable. You now own this point!

Click the link that says `Generate Urbit networking keys`. Bridge will let you either
download a keyfile derived from your networking keys are you can paste in your own
network seed and derive a new keyfile. See our
[HD Wallet Spec](https://github.com/urbit/proposals/blob/master/proposals/8.md)
for more information.

#### Step 6: Generate Your Keyfile

From the detail page associated with your point, click the `Generate Urbit Keyfile`
button and you'll be taken to a page with a field titled `Network key`. If you went
through the address registration process, this should be filled in already.
Click `Generate ->`, which will download a keyfile onto your machine.

With that keyfile in hand, you can now exit Bridge.

    ;div(id "arvo"): Installing Arvo
  ==
==

Now you're ready to run Arvo. You're almost there!

But first, some terminology:
- `vere` or `urbit`: the interpreter that runs when you run a command like `urbit` or `/bin/urbit` in your command line
- `arvo`: the deterministic OS that lives in a directory whose name matches your Azimuth point, ie `~famreb-todmec` lives in `/famreb-todmec`

Arvo runs nicely on a Unix-like operating system -- Ubuntu,
Fedora, macOS, and FreeBSD. If you're using Windows, you'll need
to get one of the aforementioned systems. Don't worry: most of them are free.

We have different installation instructions for different platforms. To install
and run Arvo, run the commands that are listed for your operating system.

On any platform, you can check your Arvo installation by running the `urbit`
command. Installation was successful if you get a block of output that begins
with the line below:

```
Urbit: a personal server operating function
```

#### MacOS

We recommend using the Homebrew package manager to run Arvo on MacOS.

```

```

If you just want to use a fake ship for development purposes, you can now use
the command of the scheme below to boot a fake `~zod`.

```
urbit -F zod -A /path/to/arvo -s -c zod
```

If you want to get on the Arvo network with your point, then continue to the
next section.


;=
  ;h2
    ;div(id "boot"): Booting Your Ship
  ==
==


Now the rubber meets the road. You'll be booting your ship with the keyfile
that you downloaded from Bridge.

#### Step 1: Find Your Point's Name

This will look something like `~lodleb-ritrul`. You can see the name of your
point(s) when you log into your wallet using the Bridge client.

;img@"http://media.urbit.org/site/bridge-0.png"(width "100%");

#### Step 2: Find the path to your keyfile

Find the absolute path to the keyfile that you downloaded from Bridge. Copy it.

#### Step 3: Run the boot command

Type `cd` in your terminal to return to your home directory. If you want to
store your ship somewhere besides your home directory, change the terminal's
working directory to the desired directory.

Run the command below, except with `~sample-planet` replaced by the name of your
Urbit identity, and `path/to/my-planet.key` replaced with the path to your
keyfile:

```
urbit -w ~sample-planet -k path/to/my-planet.key
```

if you'd prefer to copy your key in you can run

```
urbit -w ~sample-planet -G rAnDoMkEy
```


This will create a directory called `sample-planet/` and begin building your
ship. It may take a few minutes.

When your ship is finished booting, you will see the `~sample-planet:dojo>`
prompt. At that point, you should permanently erase your keyfile from your
machine.

;=
  ;h2
    ;div(id "operation"): Basic Operations
  ==
==

Welcome to your urbit! There's a few things you should do to become oriented.

#### Dojo

Let's try out the Dojo, the Arvo command line and Hoon REPL:

```
~sample-planet:dojo> (add 2 2)
```

Should produce:

```
> (add 2 2)
4
```

Good.

#### Mounting

Clay, the Arvo filesystem, isn't mounted to Unix by default. Switch to the Dojo
prompt and run:

```
~sample-planet:dojo> |mount %
```

This should produce:
```
> |mount %
>=
```

which indicates that the command was processed.

`|mount %` will cause a `home/` directory to appear inside your _pier_ folder in
Unix (the "pier" is our shorthand for the directory whose name corresponds to your Azimuth point). Changes to these files are automatically synced into your ship.


#### Talk

Use `ctrl-x` to toggle between the Dojo and the Talk prompts.

While on the Talk prompt, let's join the main Urbit support chat channel, `/urbit-help`:

```
~sample-planet:talk[] ;join /urbit-help
```

Talk is stateful, so your ship will download a backlog. `/urbit-help` is the
place to ask questions about getting up and running.

#### Shutting Down and Restarting

You can turn your ship off with `ctrl-d` from the Talk or Dojo prompts.

To restart your ship, simply pass the name of your pier:

```
$ urbit some-planet
```

#### Landscape

Your ship is also accessible through its own web interface. Through the web
interface you'll have access to our chat and message boards, the two components
of our _Landscape_ feature. This is a user-friendly way to chat with Talk on the
Arvo network and access and materials you've published on your ship. If You're
running Arvo locally on your own machine, try opening `http://localhost/` in
your browser.

Or if you're running your ship on a cloud instance with a static IP address
(which we recommend!), something like 212.131.240.20, assuming you've opened up
the HTTP port that Arvo uses -- the default is port 80. So
`http://212.131.240.20:80/~~/` would go into your browser's URL bar.

This way, if you keep your ship running securely in the cloud (usually in a
screen or tmux session), you can always access your ships's web interface in any
browser on any device, so long as you have your password on hand.

The `/~~/` in the URL will redirect you to a login page, which was generated by
Tree, the basic Arvo web interface. The page will tell you to run the +code
generator (an Arvo shell script) in your Dojo to get your password. Copy and
paste that into your password input box and hit Enter. After loading, you'll
find yourself redirected to your home page, authenticated, where you can then
use the navigation bar at the top of the page to visit your Talk web interface
and static files.

When you use the web interface, your urbit is automatically subscribed to
`/urbit-meta` and Fora, our message-board system.
