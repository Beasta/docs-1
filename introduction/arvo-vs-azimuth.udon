# Arvo vs. Azimuth

*Arvo* is the Urbit operating system. *Azimuth* is the decentralized ledger
that keeps track of identities that are required to use the Arvo network.
*Urbit* is the holistic system composed of both Arvo and Azimuth.

The Arvo network is composed of virtual machines running our software stack.
Using a blockchain for this kind of computing is impossible: there's far too
much data involved in an operating system to run on top of a distributed
consensus mechanism. And you don't want your private information on a public
ledger. The Arvo network is not on a blockchain.

But, being a decentralized system, we need some way to cryptographically secure
and authenticate your identity on the Arvo network. What keeps track of who
owns any given identity? Well, simply matching something to an address is a
small piece of computing, and a blockchain are wonderful for such a purpose.
That's where the Azimuth comes in.

We chose to build Azimuth on the Ethereum blockchain because smart contracts are
well-suited for the peculiarities of the identities. Urbit identities
are owned by Ethereum addresses.

Azimuth and the Arvo network are parallel systems. Azimuth isn't necessarily
Arvo-related; it can be used as a generalized identity system for other
projects. Azimuth is the equivalent of a bank vault that storess sthe deed to your
house. The Arvo network is the neighborhood that you live in.
